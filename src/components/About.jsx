        {/* I am a seasoned Full Stack Developer with over a year of hands-on
        experience in both frontend and backend development. My expertise
        includes JavaScript, React, and Next.js for crafting dynamic and
        responsive user interfaces, while my backend skills are centered around
        Java with Spring Boot. This dual proficiency allows me to handle complex
        development projects from concept to completion. I have worked
        extensively with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, ensuring effective data
        management and seamless application integration. My approach to
        development is supported by a range of testing tools including Postman,
        Thunder Client, cURL, and Swagger, which I use to validate and optimize
        APIs and services. In addition to my core skills, I have practical
        experience in Python, specializing in chatbot development with Rasa for
        banking applications. My tenure at Atlas Computer Technology involved
        developing backend APIs for the Ministry of Revenue project, further
        honing my skills in delivering robust and scalable solutions. I am also
        familiar with TypeScript, Linux, and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and
        Tailwind CSS. To enhance user experience, I leverage UI libraries such
        as Shadcn and Ant Design. My technical background is underpinned by a
        BSc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Wollega
        University, with a focus on Computer Engineering. This combination of
        experience and education equips me to tackle a wide range of challenges
        and deliver high-quality software solutions. */}
